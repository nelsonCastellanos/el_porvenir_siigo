## General Objective:
Develop a Golang application that allows integration with a non-relational database, specifically MongoDB, to model the data transacted by the Siggo platform.

## Specific Objectives:
* Research and understand the operation of MongoDB and its integration with Golang.
* Design a data model that allows the representation of the data transacted by Siggo in MongoDB.
* Develop a Golang application that allows connection with the MongoDB database.
* Implement the necessary functionalities in the application to allow insertion, update, deletion, and querying of transacted data.
* Conduct thorough testing to ensure the functionality and performance of the application.
* Properly document the application and data model to facilitate maintenance and future improvements.
* Provide support for the configuration and installation of the application in the production environment.

## To use the application, follow these steps:

* Install Golang and MongoDB on your system.
* Clone the repository to your local machine.
* Configure the database connection in the application.
* Build and run the application.
* Use the application to insert, update, delete, and query transacted data.
